# Fermion Scripts
## Description
These are a collection of Fermion Scripts that I have found helpful while performing reverse engineering. 

## Script Names
- called_exported_functions.js - When you know a DLL is being loaded, you want to see what exported functions are being called.
- scan_memory.js - Scan the current attached process for interesting strings.
